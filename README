Music-Tag-Amazon version 0.28
=============================

Music-Tag-Amazon is a plugin module for Music-Tag to gather information
from Amazon using Net::Amazon.

Note:  As of version 0.28, Music-Tag is distributed as seperate packages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


QUICK INSTALL OF DEPENDENCIES

   perl -MCPAN -eshell

At the cpan shell prompt type:

   install Text::LevenshteinXS
   install Text::Unaccent
   install Term::ANSIColor
   install Music::Tag::Amazon

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Music::Tag
   Cache::FileCache
   Encode
   LWP
   Net::Amazon

The version info in the Makefile is based on what I use.  You can get 
away with older versions in many cases. Do not install an older version
of MP3::Tag.

I strongly recommend the following to allow proximity matches:

   Lingua::EN::Inflect
   Lingua::Stem
   Text::LevenshteinXS
   Text::Unaccent 

The following just makes things pretty:

   Term::ANSIColor
